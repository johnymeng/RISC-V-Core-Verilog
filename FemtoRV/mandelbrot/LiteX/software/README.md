This directory contains libraries and software packages for LiteX SoCs:
- [DemoBundle](DemoBundle/): a ROM with several demo programs, to
    measure the speed of softcores (raystones), to draw shiny spheres
    with raytracing (tinyraytracer), to display animations on the
    small OLED screen (riscv-logo, julia) ...

    programs (ELF binaries) stored on the SDCard;

FemtoRV32 Design: from zero to I,II,III,IV ... RISC-V
=====================================================

![](Images/FemtoRV32_design.jpg)

_During the first confinement in March 2020, I grabbed an IceStick
just before getting stuck at home, with the idea in mind to learn
verilog and processor design. I came out with FemtoRV32, a super-simple design.
It is too basic (no pipeline), but it may be useful to somebody who
wants to quickly understand the general principles. This document
is written from my curated notes, keeping the order in which I
understood different things and how they mesh together._
